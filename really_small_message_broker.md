# Really Small Message Broker

## Introduction

Really Small Message Broker (RSMB) is an MQTT message broker produced freely (but not open source) by IBM and made available for personal use/evaluation. 

It is provided as a precompiled binary for a number of platforms including:

*  Ubuntu Linux 7.10 (Gutsy), 8.04 (Hardy) and above

*  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4

*  Windows XP

*  Unslung (Linksys NSLU2)

*  Arcom Embedded Linux (Arcom Viper)

*  Linux on IBM System z

*  Apple Mac OS X Leopard

*  Crossbow Stargate

Currently RSMB is not available for any other platforms.

For ARM V5 and above systems such as the Sheevaplug, the open source [Mosquitto](mosquitto_message_broker) broker is recommended.
