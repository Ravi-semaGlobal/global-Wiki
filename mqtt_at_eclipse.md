# MQTT and Eclipse

## Eclipse Paho

Paho is an Open Source machine-to-machine (M2M) messaging project. The project was proposed on November 3 2011 and it is currently in incubator status. Initial contributions were the Java and C clients for MQTT, donated by IBM, and an MQTT view for Eclipse from Eurotech. A Lua MQTT client was contributed shortly after the project went "live".

## Eclipse M2M Industry Working Group

On November 2 2011, IBM and Eurotech joined other partners at [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org) to form a new M2M Industry Working Group. Paho and MQTT are key to this initiative.
