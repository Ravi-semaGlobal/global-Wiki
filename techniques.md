# Useful Techniques

MQTT is a *deliberately simple* protocol. 

This enables it to be extremely efficient both on the wire, and in memory. It also makes it quick and easy to get started and to learn. 

You can think of the philosophy as being similar to a UNIX utility - it does one thing and does it well, and can be combined with other tools very easily

So... in that case... "how do I..."


*  [Secure an MQTT system](protect_broker)

*  [send one-to-one messages](one_to_one)

*  [detect which clients are on the network](presence)

*  [encode and decode MQTT message lengths](encode_decode_len)

*  [clear/"delete" a topic](clear_topic)
