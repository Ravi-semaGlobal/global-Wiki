Some implementations of MQTT (such as IBM WebSphere MQ and Mosquitto 1+) support SSL/TLS encryption as included features.

Additionally, SSL/TLS tunnels, [SSH tunnels](../ssh_tunnels) or traditional VPN protocols like IPSec may be used to encrypt the communications between the client and the broker.  

Encryption may also be applied outside of MQTT, on the data itself - in the payload of the messages, as a feature of the application.
