> It's common to have a "Security Considerations" section in protocol standards that describes areas of concern related to security. i.e. the IETF templates.
> In the next version, could something like this be added?
> I'd like to see a "security consideration" added that suggests to broker implementers that passwords should not be stored on the brokers in clear text.
