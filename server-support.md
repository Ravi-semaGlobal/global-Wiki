This page attempts to document the features that various MQTT servers (brokers) support. This is specific to their MQTT support; many of these servers have much wider capabilities beyond just MQTT.

# Limitations


*  Both MQTT.js and my-Channels Nirvana Messaging will accept connections with username and password supplied, but do not actually authenticate the connection

* IBM MessageSight supports a High-Availability mode which provides the redundancy advantage of a cluster, but does not support any sort of load balancing for MQTT.

* 2lemetry uses domains, where the first topic segment is the domain name. The `$SYS` topic space is under the domain (i.e. `com.example/$SYS/#`)

Potentially should add columns to track: LWT; additional protocols (WMQ, AMQP, MQTTs etc)

_This is in need of expanding. Please add known information about known brokers to this table and include any known limitations below it._
